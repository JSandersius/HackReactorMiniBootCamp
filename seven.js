//Write a function max that accepts an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array. 

var max = function (nums) {
    //declare var largestNum
    var largestNum = nums[0];
    //iterate through nums with a for-loop
    for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {    //i can be started wherever yuo want  
        if (nums[i] > largetsNum) {
            largestNum = nums[i];
        }
    }
    //find length of nums; this will tell us when to stop loop 
    //look at val in array 
    //compare the vals; which val is greater
    //if num greatet than other, it becomes largestNum
    return largestNum
}

max([1, 6, 8, 9, 100])

//this works!!
